                    <h2>U.M.M.G (Octet)</h2>
                    <p>This is an arrangement of Billy strayhorn's U.M.M.G. that I did for my portfolio at RAM during my first year. Here I choose to use more modern harmony found in modern jazz as well as other styles. Halfway through the piece the metric modulation creates a change of groove that gives the piece a new dimension, even though it's mainly the same harmonic and melodic material.</p>

                    <h2>Rooted and Grand (Octet)</h2>
                    <p>An experimental piece that explores the harmony you get when including the #1 (sharp one) in certain chords to (in this case) create tension.</p>
                    <p><i>The #1 is the 7th ascending perfect fifth from the root. In this case C#, with the root note C.</i></p>

                    <p>This is the result of a piano sonata I arrangeded for String quartet. It was an exercise in learning more about the string instruments.</p>

                    <h2>Electric Red / Electric Blue</h2>
                    <p>My main piece of my 2nd year recital at the Royal Academy of Music. Here I transcribed a song by Meshuggah, and used the form and their rhytmichal patterns as the basis for originally composed melody & harmony. For quartet - Drums, Bass, Piano, and synth/keyboard.</p>

                    <h2>U.M.M.G. (Lead sheet)</h2>
                    <p>All my compositions for octet and big band, such as UMMG, have lead sheets that can be performed by trios and quartets.</p>

                    <h2>One of Those</h2>
                    <p>Composed for Jazz piano trio + Saxophone. Started of as an exploration of chords that derives from both the melodic minor, and the harmonic minor modes, as well as the #1 concept.</p>
